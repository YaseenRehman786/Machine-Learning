# Machine-Learning
In this repository I explored using Linear &amp; Logistic Regression, Classification &amp; Regression Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Naives Bayesian Classifiers, K-Fold Cross Validation, and building an Artificial Neural Network. All this was conducting on 5 datasets from the UCI repository.
